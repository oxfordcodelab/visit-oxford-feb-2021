          The Radcliffe Camera (colloquially known as the "Rad Cam" or "The
          Camera"; from Latin camera, meaning 'room') is a building of Oxford
          University, England, designed by James Gibbs in neo-classical style
          and built in 1737–49 to house the Radcliffe Science Library. It is
          sited to the south of the Old Bodleian, north of the Church of St Mary
          the Virgin, and between Brasenose College to the west and All Souls
          College to the east. The Radcliffe Camera's circularity, its position
          in the heart of Oxford, and its separation from other buildings make
          it the focal point of the University of Oxford, and as such it is
          almost always included in shorthand visual representations of the
          university.

          The library's construction and maintenance was funded from the estate
          of John Radcliffe, a physician who left £40,000 upon his death in
          1714. According to the terms of his will, construction only began in
          1737, although the intervening period saw the complex purchase of the
          site. The exterior was complete in 1747 and the interior finished by
          1748, although the library's opening was delayed until 13 April 1749.
